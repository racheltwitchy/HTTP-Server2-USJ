### 1.Introduction

During part of this subject, a key protocol we cover is the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). HTTP is an application layer protocol within both the OSI and TCP/IP models, primarily used for transmitting hypermedia documents, such as HTML. It forms the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web, operating on a client-server model that facilitates the fetching of resources, like web pages, from a server to a client, typically a web browser.

The objective of the group project is to achieve a deep understanding of the HTTP protocol. This includes everything from its implementation at the lowest level to advanced details such as caching, authentication, or the implementation of REST APIs.

In this group project, we aim to implement a simplified version of the HTTP protocol from scratch, using Java, without the aid of higher-level frameworks such as SpringBoot or OkHttp.

### 2.Project Planning and Design
  #### 2.1.Initial Planning
      We spent the first few class sessions structuring the needs of the work, as well as deciding how we were going to divide up the tasks between everyone.
      We also took the opportunity to review the concepts learned about the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) during the course.
      Finally, we decided that the language that best suited our knowledge was Java.

      The objective was to develop a HTTp client server in Java without using the OkHttp or SpringBoot libraries, which already implement the functionality that we will develop in       this project.
