### 1.Introduction

During part of this subject, a key protocol we cover is the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). HTTP is an application layer protocol within both the OSI and TCP/IP models, primarily used for transmitting hypermedia documents, such as HTML. It forms the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web, operating on a client-server model that facilitates the fetching of resources, like web pages, from a server to a client, typically a web browser.

The objective of the group project is to achieve a deep understanding of the HTTP protocol. This includes everything from its implementation at the lowest level to advanced details such as caching, authentication, or the implementation of REST APIs.

In this group project, we aim to implement a simplified version of the HTTP protocol from scratch, using Java, without the aid of higher-level frameworks such as SpringBoot or OkHttp.
